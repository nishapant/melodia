## Findings
after cleaning up the data* returned from the lyrics from over 250 songs (mainly rap and r&b) from my spotify library, i came up with this bar graph with the most frequent words used in the songs.

<p>
"love" was by far the most frequent word used in the songs i analyzed with "baby" close behind, as many rappers discuss love and relationships in their music. below is a more fun way to view the same information in a word cloud, enjoy :)

i created simliar graphs with more controlled data using featured spotify playlists. analyzing the data from the "Rap Caviar" playlist and the "Soft Pop Hits" playlist, it seems that "love" is a common topic amongst these two genres. in contrast, the rap playlist had common words such as "rags", "riches", and "money" whereas the soft pop playlist used words like "state", "power", and "constitution".

additionally, the overall emotions of the playlists hugely differed. the rap caviar playlist seemed to have a fear overtone, whereas the soft pop hits playlist were more happy.
